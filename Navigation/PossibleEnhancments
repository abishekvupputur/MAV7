In ~/paparazzi/sw/airborne/modules/orange_avoider
  We can adjust the way the drone reacts to an object
  Instead of stopping and taking a random side
  We can try to implement a code which always knows the distance to the sides of the CyberZoo
  If this distance is too small the drone will automatically pick the other side.
  Also instead of a full stop maybe a speed change can be implemented.
